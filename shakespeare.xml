To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br/>
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br/>
To the last syllable of recorded time;<br/>
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br/>
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br/>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br/>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br/>
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br/>
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br/>
Signifying nothing.<br/><br/>
