From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here, that's home, that's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, <i>every</i> human being who <i>ever</i> was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our <b>joy</b> and <b>suffering</b>, thousands of confident <b>religions</b>, <b>ideologies</b>, and <b>economic doctrines</b>, every <b>hunter</b> and <b>forager</b>, every <b>hero</b> and <b>coward</b>, every <b>creator</b> and <b>destroyer</b> of civilization, every <b>king</b> and <b>peasant</b>, every young <b>couple</b> in love, every <b>mother</b> and <b>father</b>, hopeful <b>child</b>, <b>inventor</b> and <b>explorer</b>, every <b>teacher</b> of morals, every corrupt <b>politician</b>, every <b>“superstar"</b>, every <b>“supreme leader"</b>, every <b>saint</b> and <b>sinner</b> in the <i>history</i> of our species lived <i>there</i> — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br/><br/>
